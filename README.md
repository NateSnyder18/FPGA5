# FPGA5
There is one top module named multidigit. There is one sub module segConv, which was designed in previous labs, to properly display the digit I calculate with the rest of the code. The anode is based on the clock. This is done by bit shifting the previous anode so that the anode rotates between the 4 4-digit one-hot encoding values. It is important to note that this bit-shift occurs at the positive edge of the clock cycle, and a buffer time is included to ensure that the code functions with the given FPGA board. I use a case statement with the anode to select the bcd input to display for this clock cycle. Finally, the display from the segConv module is output as sseg_c_o and the anode is inverted to correctly isolate the digit I want to display for the current clock cycle. Since the module works on the positive edge of the clock, when the clock is low, the display is blank (this is represented by decimal 15 which is the same as 4â€™b1111. On each positive edge, the module correctly utilizes the seven segment converter module to display one of the digits depending on which anode is selected. The testbench uses a for loop to cycle through each digit and display the first 4 powers of 2 once for each digit,
